Hi there! Welcome to AWS Cloud9!

To get started, create some files, play with the terminal,
or visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/cloud9/ for our documentation.

Happy coding!


Basic Data Types
----------------------
we did a basic overview of lists
we did a basic overview of loops


What We Learned
-----------------
Basics of Python
Some traditional ways of handling loops and lists
Writing functions in Python
And some differences between Python and V syntax
Write functions in Python and Compare to V
        1. Before coding, write things on paper.
        2. define the function with an explicit name and parameters with an obvious return value.
        3. K.I.S.S --> keep it simple stupid.
        4. write test cases often!
        


Next Time
-----------------




Write a basic class in Python and Compare to V      -- Tomorrow
Introduce Lambda functions                          -- Tomorrow
